## Data set  
1.``30 minute sampling of indoor temperature data. CSV``: data set of temperature, humidity, light intensity and CO2 data used in the experimental part of the paper.  
  
2.``Indoor and outdoor temperature data 1.csv``: used to draw the processing effect comparison diagram of normalization method.  
  
3.``Prediction results``: all data in the folder are prediction results used to draw comparison images.   
  
## Source program  
1.``Multidimensional input normalization layer``: it is the final source program of the paper, including ``normalization layer``, ``anti normalization layer`` and ``normalization method selection module``.  
  
2.``Comparison of conventional normalization methods``: including the source code of ``dense``, ``LSTM``, ``GRU``, ``BiLSTM``, ``BiGRU``, ``attentionLSTM`` and ``attentionGRU``, which are used to compare the performance of the model.  
  
3.``mapping``: it is used to draw the comparison diagram of normalization method processing results and the display image of data set.
